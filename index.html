<h3>About me</h3>

I was born and raised in MÃ¡laga, Spain.
In 2010, I moved to Madrid to course both Computer Science and Mathematics at Autonomous University of Madrid, experience I really enjoyed and that made me eager to further my studies at a higher level.
Currently, I'm a student at University of California, San Diego, enrolled in the two year M.S. program in Computer Science, Mathematics and Engineering.
