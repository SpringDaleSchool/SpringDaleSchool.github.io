<h3>About me</h3>

I'm a student at University of California, San Diego, enrolled in the two year M.S. program in Computer Science, Mathematics and Engineering.
Previously, I finished both Computer Engineering and Mathematics at the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid, experience I really enjoyed and that made me eager to further my studies at a higher level.
