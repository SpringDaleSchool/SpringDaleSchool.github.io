Module for the [emoncms](https://github.com/emoncms/emoncms/) platform to visualize electric consumption and PV self-consumption facilities.
In order to automatically create the necessary *input* and *feeds*, another project has also been created: [ewatcher-users](https://github.com/jsidrach/ewatcher-users/).
